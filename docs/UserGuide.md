## 1. Introduction (Binh)

Are you a student of secondary to tertiary education level,
who is a fan of **using flashcards to study**,
uses laptop often, 
and likes to **schedule study sessions regularly**?
If so, we have the right product just for you!

StudyBananas is a desktop study companion app that **helps you centralize all your study tasks,
and caters to your recap needs through a flashcard-quizzes system**.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This user guide aims to equip you with all the necessary understanding to use StudyBananas effectively.

### 1.1 Reading this User Guide

Before you begin, here are some important notations that you should be aware of
when reading this user guide.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

5\. Type the command in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it.
   Some example commands you can try:

   - `list task` : Lists all `TASK`

   * `add flset name:Chemistry` : Add a new empty `FLASHCARDSET` with name `Chemistry`.

   * `delete flset 3` : Deletes the 3rd `FLASHCARDSET` in the current list of `FLASHCARDSET`.

   * `add fl flset:3 q:What is the chemical formula of water? a:H2O` : Add a flashcard to the 3rd `FLASHCARDSET`.

   * `add task T:CS2100 d: Pipeline tutorial t:2020-10-10 11:00` : Adds Doing CS2100 `TASK` to the `SCHEDULE`.

## 3. Features (Petrick)
This section describes the various features available in StudyBananas. These include front-end features that you can interact with, such as the `SCHEDULE` page, as well as back-end features such as the auto-saving of data.

### 3.1. Task list in `SCHEDULE`
You can set the `TASK` you want to do at a particular day to help you de-clutter your `TASK` and organise them 
strategically into daily `TASK`.

To help define `TASK`, you can add `title`, short `description`, starting `time` and `duration`. You can also search for `TASK` 
using a keyword, making it easier for you to group `TASK`.

There are no limits to how many `TASK` you can add in StudyBananas:
No matter how busy you are, StudyBananas can adapt to your needs and still function normally! 

### 3.2. Time Scale in `SCHEDULE`
StudyBananas helps you visualise your day and manage your time efficiently by creating a time scale that
shows the timespan of different `TASK` in a daily timeline.

It comes with a time pointer that helps you recognise the `TASK` that you need to do at certain specific point in time during the day, 
so you can manage your time properly and complete `TASK` in an appropriate duration.

Note: The time scale only shows the `TASK` happening today in the current displayed `task list`. If you 
[search for `TASK`](#415-search-for-a-task-search-task), which changes the displayed `task list`, your 
`time scale` changes accordingly.

### 3.3. `FLASHCARD`
StudyBananas is about learning effectively, so it comes with a `FLASCHCARD` feature that helps you consolidate your 
learning into one place, without ever needing to open multiple files for revision. 

There are also no limit to how much `FLASHCARD` sets you can make, and same goes to the amount of `FLASHCARD` in a `FLASHCARDSET`. 
(Just like how there is no limit to learning!)

<p style="page-break-before: always"></p>

### 3.4. `QUIZ`
Learning is not effective if you only read materials, but never exercise your memory for it. The `QUIZ` feature helps 
you to practice active recalling that will solidify all your learning points.

The feature also comes with a statistics panel that displays your performance over time, 
along with indicators to show the questions you got right (or wrong), so you can be aware of your 
study development and revise strategically.

You can also set `QUIZ` as a task in your `SCHEDULE`. Click [here](#4122-adding-a-quiz-task) to find out how!

### 3.5. CLI-GUI interactivity
You can operate StudyBananas in two ways: using the Command Line Interface (CLI) and typing out commands using the keyboard, 
or using the Graphical User Interface (GUI) if you feel using the mouse is faster for you!

Either you are a fast typist or someone who is faster using the mouse cursor, we ensure that StudyBananas work efficiently according to your preferences, so time is spent just on studying.
See how you can navigate yourself using either keyboard or mouse by clicking [here](#10-graphical-summary-of-navigation-commands-petrick).

### 3.6. Auto-save
In StudyBananas, all `TASK`, `FLASHCARD` and `QUIZ`Â attempts you create will generate a JSON file named after the respectiveÂ feature. These files can be found in theÂ dataÂ folder, under the directory that you have previously stored the StudyBananas JAR file in. This folder stores all your study-related data created using StudyBananas.

<p align="center" >
  <img src="images/StorageJSON.png" alt="StorageJSON" />
</p>
<div align="center">Figure 3.6: Location of StudyBananas JSON files</div>
<br>

All `TASK`, `FLASHCARD` and `QUIZ`Â attempts created will be automatically saved, so there is no need for 
you to manually save the app's data!

## 4. Usage of Command

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:** (Binh)
<br>

- Words wrapped with angled brackets `<>` are compulsory parameters or prefix-parameter pairs to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. In `add <flset:setname>`, `flset:` is the prefix and `setname` is the parameter, which can be used as `add flset:Chemistry`.

- Words wrapped with square brackets `[]` are optional parameters or prefix-parameter pairs to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. In `add task <T:title> [d:description]`, `d:` is the prefix while `description` is the parameter. The command can be used as `add task T: CS2103T d: Post-lecture quiz` or as `add task T: CS2103T`.

- Prefix-parameter pairs can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. If the command specifies `<flset:setindex> <q:question> <a:answer>`, `<a:answer> <q:question> <flset:setindex>` is also acceptable.

- The same prefix-parameter pair can be used in a same command, however only the value of the last pair is used. <br>
  e.g. In `add task T: CS2103T d: Tutorial Week 2 T: CS2100`, there are 2 parameters with the prefix `T:` but only the latter, `CS2100`, is taken as the input value for `T:`.

### 4.1. Commands for the `SCHEDULE` page (Binh except 4.1.1)

[4.1.1. View the details of your task (Eddy)](#411-view-the-details-of-your-task-eddy) <br>
[4.1.2. Add a task](#412-add-a-task-add-task) <br>
[4.1.3. List all your tasks](#413-list-all-your-task-list-task) <br>
[4.1.4. Delete a task](#414-delete-a-task-delete-task) <br>
[4.1.5. Search for a task](#415-search-for-a-task-search-task) <br>
[4.1.6. Edit a task](#416-edit-a-task-edit-task) <br>

#### 4.1.1. View the details of your `TASK` (Eddy)

There are several panels in our user interface that provides the details of your `TASK`.

- Firstly, the `today's time scale` lists out all of your study sessions happening today, which are `TASK`, with start time and duration. You can click on your study session on the time scale to view the details on the top right panel.
- Secondly, the `list panel` located in the bottom right corner of the `SCHEDULE` tab lists all of your `TASK`, you can scroll down to view the details of your `TASK`, or take advantage of the search feature to quickly find a specific task (refer to [search task section](#415-search-for-a-task-search-task)).
- In the following user guide, we use `time scale` to refer to the middle panel of `SCHEDULE` tab, and uses `TASK` lists to refer to the bottom right panel.

<br>

<p style="page-break-before: always"></p>

#### 4.1.2. Add a `TASK`: `add task`

If you would like to add a study `TASK` to your `SCHEDULE`, this command allows you to create a `TASK` and saves it to the
`SCHEDULE`, while specifying the `title`, `description`, `time` and `duration` of the task.

After you add a new `TASK` to StudyBananas, the `TASK`'s information is saved in the `schedule.json` file.

You can also add a `QUIZ` as a valid `TASK` by entering the `quiz <flset:setindex>` command (refer to [`QUIZ` of a `FLASHCARDSET`](#431-quiz-of-a-flashcardset-quiz-flset)) in the `description` field.

| Format                                | `add task <T:title> [d:description] [t:time] [dur: duration]`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

#### 4.1.4. Delete a `TASK`: `delete task`

If you complete a `TASK` and would like to remove that specific `TASK` from your `SCHEDULE`, this command helps you remove the task at the specified `index`.

Upon deletion of the `TASK`, the saved information of the `TASK` in `schedule.json` file will be deleted as well.

| Format                                          | `delete task <index>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Example                                         | `delete task 2`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ![info_icon](images/UG/info_icon.png)           | â€¢ The `index` refers to the index number shown in the fully displayed `SCHEDULE` after you [list task](#413-list-all-your-task-list-task). <br> â€¢ The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, â€¦â€‹ and within range of the number of `TASK` you have in your `SCHEDULE`. |
| ![important_icon](images/UG/important_icon.png) | â€¢ This action is irreversible. Once you delete a specific `TASK`, the `TASK` and its respective information are removed from the storage file as well.                                                                                                                      |

<br>

<p style="page-break-before: always"></p>

**Expected Outcome**:

For example, you just finished the `TASK` at `index` 4 in the `SCHEDULE`, _CS2100 Lab_ and you
would like to update your `SCHEDULE` by deleting that `TASK`.

1\. Find the `index` of the `TASK` to be deleted with the [list task](#413-list-all-your-task-list-task) command.

2\. From the figure below, you can identify the `TASK` to be deleted has an `index` of 4, enter the command `delete task 4`.

#### 4.1.5. Search for a `TASK`: `search task`

If you have trouble finding certain specific `TASK`, you can search for them using a certain **keyword(s)**. This command displays any `TASK` that its `title`
contains _any_ of the given **keyword(s)** or its `description` and `time` contains _all_ of the given **keyword(s)**.

| Format                                | `search task <keywords>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Example                               | `search task CS2103T PE` <br> `search task Normal distribution assignment` <br> `search task 2020-11-10`                                                                                                                                        |
| ![info_icon](images/UG/info_icon.png) | â€¢ The search **keyword(s)** is case-insensitive. For instance, `homework` matches `HomeWork`. <br> â€¢ The search requires a complete match of the **keyword**. For instance, `CS2103` does not match `CS2103T` as they are not a complete match. |

<br>

<p style="page-break-before: always"></p>

**Expected Outcome**:

For example, you would like to search for a `TASK` in the `SCHEDULE` with the **keyword** _Lab 8_. StudyBananas
searches for all `TASK` containing _Lab 8_ in their `title`, `description` and `time` and displays all matching tasks.

1\. Enter the command `search task Lab 8` to search for `TASK` with the **keyword** _Lab 8_.

##### 4.3.1.1. Getting the question
When the `QUIZ` launches, as seen below, you will see the question
of the first `FLASHCARD` within the selected `FLASHCARDSET`,
as well as an instruction prompt to type in the next available commands,
`flip`, `<ans:answer>`, `refresh` or `cancel`.

**Expected Outcome:**

<div align="center">Figure 4.3.1.1: Result of <code> quiz flset:CS2103T</code> command</div>

<br>
<p style="page-break-before: always"></p>

##### 4.3.1.2. Answering the question
If you would like to see your answer directly, enter `flip`. 
However, if you would like StudyBananas to store your answer for later reference,
enter your answer with `<ans:answer>`.

| Format         | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flip`         | Does not store your answer. Displays the answer to the `FLASHCARD` question. <br> (You may opt to remember your answer for evaluation against the correct answer later) |
| `<ans:answer>` | Stores your answer. Also, displays the answer to the `FLASHCARD` question.                                                                                              |

If the command entered is `flip` or `<ans:answer>`,
the correct answer will be displayed,
and you will be prompted to enter the next available commands, `c`, `w`, `refresh` or `cancel`,
as shown below.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Expected Outcome:**

| `c`    | Indicates that the question of the `FLASHCARD` is answered _correctly_. |
| `w`    | Indicates that the question of the `FLASHCARD` is answered _wrongly_.   |

The question of the next `FLASHCARD` will be displayed.

<br>

##### 4.3.1.4. Continuing the `QUIZ` cycle
Steps 4.3.1.1-4.3.1.3 are repeated until all `FLASHCARD` in the `FLASHCARDSET` are displayed and answered.

Once the quiz stops, the score statistics will be displayed.
You can also view this score by viewing the last attempt of the `FLASHCARDSET`.
(see [View last quiz attempt: `quiz score flset`](#432-view-last-quiz-attempt-quiz-score-flset))

## 6. Trouble Shooting (Eddy)

### **Cannot launch the application**

- Check if you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. 

#### Windows

1.  Open command prompt and type `java -version`. 

    - If you get the version info, Java is installed correctly and PATH is also set correctly. You can skip the rest.
    

2. Go to `start menu` -> `System` -> `Advanced` -> `Environment Variables`. Set `JAVA_HOME` to the path of your `JDK`, and update the system path. For more details, please refer to this <a href="https://javatutorial.net/set-java-home-windows-10">website</a> 

3.  If none of the above work, try to search your file system for `javac.exe`. If there is no `javac.exe`, download `JDK` from <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html">the Oracle Website for JDK</a> and install.

#### Mac

1. Open terminal and type `java -version`.

    - If you get the version info and have made sure that the version is `11` or above, your `Java` is installed correctly. You can skip the rest.
    
2. Go to <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html">the Oracle Website for JDK</a> and download the macOS version `JDK` and install.
 
#### Linux

1. Open up your terminal, and type `find / -name "java"`

2. If the path for `JDK` is shown after the command, type` export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java/jdk1.x`, otherwise go to <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html">the Oracle Website for JDK</a> and download the `JDK` version of Linux and install.

### **Cannot find my data locally**

Your `SCHEDULE`, `FLASHCARD`, and `QUIZ` records data are stored inside the folder named **data** which would reside in the folder where you put your `StudyBananas.jar`.

If you still cannot find any default data, make sure you have **enter at least one command** in the command box after your first launch, the default data is only stored after the first command is executed.

### **My data is gone after I manipulate the data in the data folder directly**

The data is stored in the format of JSON for StudyBananas. Our development team does not recommend modifying data from the data folder directly, but 
if after you edit and the data is not shown in your application, it is likely that the format of JSON file is wrong.  
  
Please open your storage file in
text editors that support JSON file static check e.g. `Visual Studio Code`, `IntelliJ` and modify your file into valid JSON format with the help of the text editor.  
 
After editing, place the file with correct JSON format back to the **data** folder and make sure the file name is the same as it was. Then, relaunch StudyBananas, you should 
be able to see the updated data.


| ![important_icon](images/UG/important_icon.png) | <span style="font-weight:normal">Our application reads the storage files by its</span> **path**, <span style="font-weight:normal">please make sure the storage files are named as</span> **flashcardbank.json**<span style="font-weight:normal">,</span> **quizrecords.json** <span style="font-weight:normal">and</span> **schedule.json** |

## 7. Community and security (Eddy)

### **User data**

StudyBananas is designed to be a self-study tool and not an online study community.

We do not store your data through any cloud database. All your schedules and notes are 
only collected and manipulated under your local folder which is named **data** by our 
development team. Therefore, the physical integrity of the your data is secured within 
StudyBananas. 


### **Study community**

Current version of StudyBananas - 1.4 does not support any functionality required 
internet connection.

Many feedback that we have received request for the functionality of sharing data in 
a user's study community. Therefore, our team decides to build a cloud community in 
the version 2.0 release of StudyBananas, and plans to build the sharing functionality
as well as other community related functionality afterwards. But take note that our 
team still believes internet-connection can be a huge distraction for studying, the 
upcoming cloud community will not support chat room or other social media like features.
StudyBananas will still be optimized without internet connection.

## 8. Bug report (Eddy)

Version 1.4 StudyBananas is still under testing phase. Version 1.4 release would serve
as the public beta testing for StudyBananas. We have done comprehensive amount of unit tests 
and integration tests on the application, and have put StudyBananas under preliminary alpha 
testing by some students in NUS SoC.  

However, there can still be some unnoticed bugs. If you spot
any bugs or have any suggestions on the application, please go to 
<a href="https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/issues">our GitHub issue page</a> to 
issue the bugs and the suggestions. Great appreciation from the development team of StudyBananas.
