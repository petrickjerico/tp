# Joe Teddy Yosua Sanjaya - Project Portfolio

## Introduction
Hi, my name is Teddy. At the time of this project (AY20/21 Semester 1), I was a Year 2 Computer Science undergraduate in NUS.

I am a software developer in Team Volant. That’s the team that is working on this wonderful travel companion app! We’re really passionate about this project, so we hope that you enjoy the product as much as we enjoy the process.

You can find out more about me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeteddyyosuasanjaya/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/cupofjoee)

## Overview
**StudyBananas** is a desktop study companion app that helps students centralize all their study tasks and set up focused study sessions into one place, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is written in Java and it is primarily based off of the [Address Book Level 3 (AB3)](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3) application developed by the CS2103T teaching team.

## Enhancements Implemented

* **Major Enchancement**: `FLASHCARD` feature and testing (backend)

  * **What it does**   
    
    The `FLASHCARD` feature allows users to start and manage their collections of `FLASHCARD`. Users can create multiple `FLASHCARDSET` which can contain multiple `FLASHCARD`.

  * **Justification**
    
    Integrated with the `QUIZ` feature, this allows students to recap their concepts using the flashcard study technique.

  * **Highlights**
    
    The nesting of lists of lists have to be handled carefully when recording them to json files.

    Implements duplication detection for possible future `FILTER` function.

* **Major Enhancement**: Quality Assurance

  * **Justification**

    I was the 'QA' guy in the team.

  * **Highlights**

    Continuously testing and managing bug reporting.
